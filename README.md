# 🚀 MyTools

## 📖 About this repo

At some point, I found myself in need of certain tools to accomplish specific tasks.  
I thought, _"If only there was a tool that could do this."_  
So, why not develop them myself?

This repository is the result of that idea.

## 📜 Some rules

### 🏷️ Branch Nomenclature

- **Creating a tool/project:**  
  Branch name format:  
  `tool/<project_name>`  
  Each new tool or program gets its own branch, where `<project_name>` is the actual tool's name.

- **Adding new features:**  
  Branch name format:  
  `tool/<project_name>/feat/<feature_name>`  
  Experimental features or proofs of concept belong to _feature branches_ under their respective projects.

### ⚙️ Workflow

- Each branch contains a different program under development, following the naming conventions above.

- Every branch is self-explanatory, including its own instructions and details about the programming language used.

- When a program becomes usable or stable, it should be merged into the `main` branch.

- The `main` branch contains only stable, ready-to-use programs.

- New development or experimental features happen in _**feature branches**_ as specified.

- Contributions or improvements should be done by creating or updating the corresponding `tool/<project_name>` branch, then merging into `main` when ready.
